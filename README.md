## Incredible data for drawing images!!!
Feasibility experiment of converting data into images

The commonly used encrypted data results are usually based on hexadecimal data as the final output value

Can we further convert the resulting data into RGB values and output them as an image?

Based on the results of this type of data, experimental operations and testing are carried out. Given the end data, a zero filling method is used, and the first color block of the prefix informs the value of the zero filling

Finally, I obtained an image file based on pixel blocks

If we can further manipulate this type of image data and restore it to the source data, is this method of encryption feasible?

Can the user's secret key form be guaranteed through the processing of images? Can users store user information based on an image file and then operate a series of functions offline?

## Highly available image login method!!!
Even if the user's key is the image

user's upload the image use login

Is it possible to achieve de user operation, and can the server not store user information but return it to the user?

Can this achieve the concept of user first and create a more epoch-making operating method?
